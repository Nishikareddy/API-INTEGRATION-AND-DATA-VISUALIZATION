DESCRIPTION:
The Weather Data Visualization Dashboard is a Python project I created during my internship at CodTech. The main goal of this project is to collect and display weather forecast data in a way that is easy to understand. This dashboard helps users check the upcoming weather, like temperature and humidity, for any city they choose. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get real-time weather information and then shows this data using line graphs created with Matplotlib and Seaborn, two popular Python libraries for visualization.
The project starts by setting up the city name, unit of measurement (like Celsius), and the API key from OpenWeather. The program then sends a request to the API and receives a 5-day forecast. The forecast includes data every 3 hours, such as the temperature and humidity for that time. If there’s a problem, like a wrong city name or an issue with the API key, the program catches the error and shows a helpful message instead of crashing. This makes the tool more reliable and user-friendly.
Once the data is received, the program sorts it into lists — one for the date and time, one for the temperatures, and one for humidity. It then creates two separate line graphs. The first graph shows how the temperature changes over the 5-day period, and the second graph shows how the humidity levels change. The graphs are clearly labeled with dates, values, and titles so that anyone can understand what they are looking at. The x-axis labels are rotated slightly so they don’t overlap and are easy to read.
This dashboard can be helpful in many real-life situations. For example, if someone is planning a trip or an outdoor event, they can quickly check how the weather will be in the next few days. It’s also useful for daily planning—like knowing when it might rain or how hot or humid it will be at a certain time. The dashboard presents this information in a clean and visual way so that users don’t have to read through long blocks of text or numbers.
Building this project helped me improve my skills in Python, especially in working with APIs, handling JSON data, and creating data visualizations. It showed me how coding can be used to turn live data into something useful and easy to understand. This kind of project is a good example of how technology can make daily life easier by helping us plan better and stay informed.
Overall, the Weather Dashboard is a simple, helpful tool that brings together live data and clear visuals. It can be improved further in the future, for example by adding more weather details, allowing the user to choose different cities from the app, or turning it into a web-based tool.
